      \item\textbf{Find the value $c$ that satisfies the Mean Value Theorem.}

            \text{Mean value theorem: } \[f'(c) = \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a}\]

                  \item 7. See graph pg. 295
                        \begin{align*}
                              f'(c) & = \frac{f(0) - f(5)}{0 - 5} \\
                              f'(c) & = \frac{1 - 3}{0 - 5}       \\
                              f'(c) & = \frac{2}{5}
                        \end{align*}
                        We know the graph has a slope of $\frac{2}{5}$ at c, therefore $3<c<4$. How does the book narrow to 3.8?
                  \item 8. See graph pg. 295. Mean value theorem does not apply. Function is non-differentiable at 4.
            \end{description}

      \item\textbf{Verify the function satisfies Rolle's Theorem and find all numbers $c$.}
            \begin{description}
                  \item 11. $f(x) = \sin{(x/2)}$, \space [$\pi/2$, \space $3\pi/2$]

                        Function is continuous on the open interval, differentiable on the closed interval, and $f(\pi/2)=f(3\pi/2)$.

                        c = $\pi$ because $f(\pi) = 0$ and $\pi$ is in the interval.
            \end{description}
      \item\textbf{Find c with Mean Value Theorem.} % empty item to keep spacing on problems with no
            \begin{description}
                  \item   21. $f(x) = (x-3)^{-2}$, \space [1, \space 4]
            \end{description}

            Function is not continuous at 3, therefore the MVT does not apply on this interval.
      \item\textbf{Verify the function has only one real solution.}
            \begin{description}
                  \item 23. $2x + \cos{x} = 0$

                        Function is differentiable for all real numbers. We apply Intermediate Value Theorem to
                        show there is at least one solution.
                        \begin{align*}
                              2\left(-\frac{\pi}{2}\right) + \cos{\left(-\frac{\pi}{2}\right)} = -\frac{2\pi}{2} - 1 &  & 2\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) + \cos{\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)} = \frac{2\pi}{2} + 1
                        \end{align*}
                        We get one positive and one negative number. Since $f(x)$ is continuous, we know that there must
                        be at least one root. Then, we show that the derivative has NO real roots. Hence, the graph is
                        always decreasing or increasing and never ``turns'' back towards the $x$ axis.
                        \begin{align*}
                              2 + -\sin{x} & = 0 &  & \text{implicit differentiation}
                        \end{align*}
                        $-1 \leq sin{x} \leq 1$, so there are no real solutions to the above equation.

                        Therefore, there can only be one solution to the original function.
                  \item 25. $x^3 - 15x + c = 0$ on the interval [-2, 2 ]
                        \begin{align*}
                              (-2)^3 - 15(-2) + c = 22 + c \\
                              (2)^3 - 15(2) + c = -22 + c
                        \end{align*}
                        $-2 \leq c \leq 2$, so regardless of what $c$ is, one solution is positive and one is negative.
                        \begin{align*}
                              3x^2 - 15 = 0 &  & \text{implicit differentiation} \\
                              3x^2 = 15                                          \\
                              x^2 = 5                                            \\
                              x = \pm \sqrt{5}
                        \end{align*}
                        The solutions to the derivative falls outside the interval. Thus, since the graph "turns" back
                        towards the x axis after the interval, the interval can not have more than one real solution.
            \end{description}
      \item\textbf{Show that a polynomial of degree $n$ has at most $n$ real roots.}
            \begin{description}
                  \item 27. Proof by induction. First, we define a one degree polynomial. Assuming $a \neq 0$
                        \begin{align*}
                              0 & = ax + b      \\
                              x & =-\frac{b}{a}
                        \end{align*}
                        Because $a$ can't be 0, this fraction always evaluates to a real number. Therefore this polynomial
                        has one real root. Next, we make this polynomial a degree higher.
                        \begin{align*}
                              f(x) & = (ax + b)(x - c)
                        \end{align*}
                        We know that $(x - c)$ has no more than 1 real solution, $c$. This second degree polynomial can't have more than two solutions
                        (one from the first degree polynomial, and at most one from our factor). We can continue this process to an $n$ degree polynomial.
                        Therefore, an $n$ degree polynomial has at most $n$ real solution(s).
            \end{description}
      \item\textbf{Prove.}
            \begin{description}
                  \item 33. $\sin{x} < x$ if $0 \leq x \leq 2\pi$

                        Both functions are differentiable on the open interval. We can use the MVT to compare mean instantaneous rates
                        of change.
                        \begin{align*}
                              f'(c) = \frac{f(2\pi) - f(0)}{2\pi - 0} &  & \text{MVT for } & f(x) = sin{x} \\
                              f'(c) = \frac{1 - 0}{2\pi - 0}                                               \\
                              f'(c) = \frac{1}{2\pi}                                                       \\[2em]
                              f'(c) = 1                               &  & \text{MVT for } & f(x) = x
                        \end{align*}
                        This tells us the mean slope for $sin(x)$ is less or equal to $x$ on the interval.

                        Next, find derivatives.
                        \begin{align*}
                              \cos{x} \leq 1
                        \end{align*}

                        $f'(x) = \cos{x}$ has only one real root, $f'(x) = 1$ has no real roots. We know that the slope
                        for both functions was the same initially (plug in start of interval to both derivatives), the slope of $x$ NEVER decreases, and the slope of
                        $\sin(x)$ ONLY decreases on this interval. Therefore $\sin{x} < x$ on the interval.
